Final notes
-----------
The Vagrantfile and lamp.json roles are for demo purposes only. 
Please create your own, i am sure they are not perfect examples.
The role lamp.json does not set a password to the mysq root user - avoid using this in production.

Todos
------
- Start Apache  
- The Mysql cookbook version is frozen at 3.0.4, the latest version seems to have issues on Ubuntu 14.04. Need to see if newer versions can be supported
- Set up some Travis test cases. Test that all services are installed an running.
